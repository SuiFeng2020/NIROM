# Transfinite maps

## Abstract

We present a method to generate a non-affine transfinite map from a given reference domain to a family of deformed domains. The map is a generalization of the Gordonâ€“Hall transfinite interpolation approach. It is defined globally over the reference domain. Once we have computed some functions over the reference domain, the map can be generated by knowing the parametric expressions of the boundaries of the deformed domain. Being able to define a suitable map from a reference domain to a desired deformation is useful for the management of parameterized geometries.

### Main idea

The idea behind the transfinite maps (TMs) is to deform the interior points of the physical domain through a linear combinations of the deformed points belonging to the boundaries.

### Offline stage

For each side of the reference domain, we associate one weight function $\varphi_i$ with one projection function $\pi_{i}$ .For a domain with $n$ sides, we have to solve $2n$ elliptic problems; however, these computations are independent of the deformation (and so of the parameter $\mu$ ) and they could be included in the offline stage (computed just once) to guarantee computational efficiency.

$$
\boldsymbol{d}\_{i}(t, \boldsymbol{\mu})=\boldsymbol{\psi}_{i}(t, \boldsymbol{\mu})-\tilde{\boldsymbol{\psi}}_{i}(t)

$$
\boldsymbol{d}\_{i}(t, \boldsymbol{\mu})
